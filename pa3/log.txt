I acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should "drive" roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together,
and at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must be reviewed $
partner. The object is to work together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into two pieces with each partner working on a different $
I spent 6 HOURS working alone.
We spent 4 HOURS working together on this assignment.
I estimate that of the time spent with my partner, I "drove" 60 PERCENT of the time.
